Your job is to FIX or REBUILD the following JSON so that it becomes valid.

Rules:
- Always output a complete JSON object with this structure:

{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task": "",
      "priority": "",
      "category": "",
      "estimated_minutes": 0,
      "deadline": null,
      "tags": []
    }
  ]
}

- If the input JSON cannot be repaired, CREATE an EMPTY structure:
{
  "tasks": []
}

- Do not output explanations.
- Do not write comments.
- Do not include text outside JSON.
